# Super BASIC Calculator

Created this following the [Real Python tutorial](https://realpython.com/python-pyqt-gui-calculator/)

Very easy to follow and understand tutorial.  The calculator is more or less functional, but could obviously use a few other QoL to be really passable.  Mainly the ability to use the keyboard/numpad.

Tutorial said eval() was a security risk as well; could look into that for why and expand.

May continue to do some PyQt or check out tkinter.
